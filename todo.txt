# Next steps
1. Check if get_current_tcp_pose works correctly by testing the offset transforms when robot end-effector z-axis points into the x-axis
        - Yes, get_current_tcp_pose using isaac lab math functions works accurately as tested in BitBucket isaac_lab_peg_in_hole_manual
2. Check if get_current_tcp_pose works with multiple environments
        - Yes it works
3. Train PPO agent
        - Works. It solved the issue
4. Get robotiq gripper working
        - Not yet working
5. Train PPO agent for reach target pose task
        - Worked



1. Training: PPO reach pose task - rel diff IK control and tcp_pose (7,)
        - Very good
2. Training: PPO reach pose task - abs diff IK control and tcp_pose (7,)
        - Takes more timesteps to get good result
3. Training: PPO reach pose task - rel diff IK control and tcp_pose (6,)
        -

1. Penalize TCP speed/acceleration
2. Analyse force/torque issue (visualize frames and try different movement while recording forces)
3. Write section force/torque validation
4. Write section short explanation of observation plots and the illustrated issue
5. What friction/restitution coefficients to choose - General rules/values?
6. Describe what to write in each section

1. Get connection to real robot
2. Apply trained agent on real robot
