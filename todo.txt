# Next steps
1. Check if get_current_tcp_pose works correctly by testing the offset transforms when robot end-effector z-axis points into the x-axis
        - Yes, get_current_tcp_pose using isaac lab math functions works accurately as tested in BitBucket isaac_lab_peg_in_hole_manual
2. Check if get_current_tcp_pose works with multiple environments
        - Yes it works
3. Train PPO agent
        - Works. It solved the issue
4. Get robotiq gripper working
        - Not yet working
5. Train PPO agent for reach target pose task
        - Worked



1. Training: PPO reach pose task - rel diff IK control and tcp_pose (7,)
        - Very good
2. Training: PPO reach pose task - abs diff IK control and tcp_pose (7,)
        - Takes more timesteps to get good result
3. Training: PPO reach pose task - rel diff IK control and tcp_pose (6,)
        - 
4. Training: SAC reach pose task - with whatever results were the best above
5. Training: TD3 reach pose task - with whatever results were the best above

1. Write section force/torque validation, 
2. Write section domain randomization validation
3. Write section short explanation of observation plots and the illustrated issue
4. Google problem that action is larger than the actual problem performed in the environments
5. What friction/restitution coefficients to choose - General rules/values?
6. Record video of m3itgft1 run and add it to PowerPoint




4. Get connection to real robot
5. Apply trained agent on real robot
