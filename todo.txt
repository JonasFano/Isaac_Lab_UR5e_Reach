# Next steps
1. Check if get_current_tcp_pose works correctly by testing the offset transforms when robot end-effector z-axis points into the x-axis
        - Yes, get_current_tcp_pose using isaac lab math functions works accurately as tested in BitBucket isaac_lab_peg_in_hole_manual
2. Check if get_current_tcp_pose works with multiple environments
        - Yes it works
3. Train PPO agent
        - Works. It solved the issue
4. Get robotiq gripper working
        - Not yet working
5. Train PPO agent for reach target pose task
        - Worked



1. Training: PPO reach pose task - rel diff IK control and tcp_pose (7,)
        - Very good
2. Training: PPO reach pose task - abs diff IK control and tcp_pose (7,)
        - Takes more timesteps to get good result
3. Training: PPO reach pose task - rel diff IK control and tcp_pose (6,)
        -

1. Analyse force/torque issue (add a mass to the gripper)
2. Write section force/torque validation
3. Analyse why reach pose task does not work on real robot
4. Write section short explanation of observation plots and the illustrated issue (action scaling section?)
5. What friction/restitution coefficients to choose - General rules/values?
6. How to randomize starting pose of the robot? Sample Pose and then use IK to get joint positions?
