# Next steps
1. Check if get_current_tcp_pose works correctly by testing the offset transforms when robot end-effector z-axis points into the x-axis
        - Yes, get_current_tcp_pose using isaac lab math functions works accurately as tested in BitBucket isaac_lab_peg_in_hole_manual
2. Check if get_current_tcp_pose works with multiple environments
        - Yes it works
3. Train PPO agent
        - Works. It solved the issue
4. Get robotiq gripper working
        - Not yet working
5. Train PPO agent for reach target pose task
        - Worked



1. Training: PPO reach pose task - rel diff IK control and tcp_pose (7,)
2. Training: PPO reach pose task - abs diff IK control and tcp_pose (7,)
3. Training: PPO reach pose task - rel diff IK control and tcp_pose (6,)
4. Training: SAC reach pose task - with whatever results were the best above
5. Training: TD3 reach pose task - with whatever results were the best above
